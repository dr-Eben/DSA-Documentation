# DSA-Documentation
This details my journey with DSA both the sad and the good aspect 
First of all a big shout out to my facilitators they are great teachers with angelic voices spoke to us as if they invented the tech skill..
working on this project was not an easy one as it is my first solo work without the help of our rabbis . 

## AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEW ANALYSIS
The files giving contains data set of a company's product review,
we were to analyze this products and solve the tasks laid out for us.
[EBENEZER CHUKWUEMEKA OBIUKWU DSA PROJECT (ON EXCEL).xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21078311/EBENEZER.CHUKWUEMEKA.OBIUKWU.DSA.PROJECT.ON.EXCEL.xlsx)

The link above shows my ability to analyze the document using some specific tools and functions 
I was able to identify the average discount % by product category, numericalize the products listed under each category, id the 3 products with the highest average rating of (5) and this products are the Amazon basic wireless mouse,REDTECH USB-C to lightnining cable  and the SYNCWIRE LTG to usb cable . Was able to compare the average actaul price with the discounted price for each product in the file above.

Also discovered that the product with the highest number of reviews (with about 853945 reviews) is the AMAZONBASIC Flexible Premium HDMI CABLE,And about 752 products of the 1465 products has discount of 50%. I actualize the total potential revenue also,identifield the number of unique products per price range, sorted out the categories with the highest discount by products and finally was able to identify after serious keen analysis the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined those products involed 3 amazon, 2 Boat BassHead earphones ( taffy pink and furious red).

I am very proud of the work i did and how far i have developed myself through doing the project thanks to my honourable facilitators and chiefs from Sir. Muhsin Hameed (the acara master), Sir. Femi Ayodele (sql master) and finally Sir. Temidayo Ayeni (TeeDee) thank you all .
